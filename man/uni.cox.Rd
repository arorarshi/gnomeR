\usage{
uni.cox(X, surv.dat, surv.formula, filter = 0, genes = NULL, is.gen = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix/surv.datframe of genomic features, continuous or binary (note cannot handle categorical surv.dat for the moment).}

\item{surv.dat}{a surv.dat frame containing the survival information. This can be made of 2 or 3 columns. 1 or 2 for time,
and one for status (where 1 is event and 0 is no event).}

\item{surv.formula}{a survival formula with names matching those in surv.dat eg: Surv(time,status)~.}

\item{filter}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 (1 not included) that is the lower bound for the proportion of patients
having a genetic event (only for binary features). All features with an event rate lower than that value will be removed.
Default is 0 (all features included).}

\item{genes}{a character vector of gene names that will be the only ones to be kept. Default is NULL, all genes are used.}

\item{is.gen}{boolean specifying is the matrix X inputted is of binary genetic factors. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
tab A table of all the fits performed sorted by adjusted pvalues.

p An interactive plot of log(pvalue) by hazard ration.

KM List of survival plots of the top 10 most significant genes
}
\description{
Performs univariate cox proportional hazard model on every feature
